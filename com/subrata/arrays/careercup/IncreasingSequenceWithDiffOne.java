/**
 * 
 * You are given an array of N elements. Each element in the range Min of int to Max of Int. 
 * You need to find the length of longest sequence in this array such that difference of largest and smallest element of that sequence is 1. 
 * The sequence need not be sequential. 

For e.g. array[]={6,10,6,7,8,9,0} 
seq {6,10} = diff is 4 len 2 
seq { 10,7,8} diff is 3 len 3 
seq { 7,8,9} diff 2 len 3 
seq {6,6,7} diff is 1 len 3  

In this example the program should return 3 .
